## Description

The deployed web application can be found at: https://cascadecolin.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

This application is intended to be a scheduling and time management tool for its users.  Users can seperate out events of their work day into one-hour blocks and write as many events as they need into each timeblock.  Each line has a save button so that the user can still access their planner at a later time.  To enhance focus, each timeblock is also color coordinated based upon the current time.  For example, if it is currently 12:31pm, then the 12PM timeblock will be red.  Every previous timeblock will be a faded red, with upcoming timeblocks being green.
